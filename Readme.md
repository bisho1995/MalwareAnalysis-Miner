SOLUTION
I am keeping the thread in case someone faces the same trouble

Find svchostc.exe (not svchost.exe) in task manager & delete it from the original location.
Also, clean up the registry & delete temporary files from %temp%
The svchostc.exe executed the following bat files and downloaded the virus files in the temp folder and all is history.
